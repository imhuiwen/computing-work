story of mdm goh
she loves to say _ogay_ but doesnt realise its funny :D
when we say "I thought no homework."
she says , "you though who confirm?"
one day, she taught us how to control your anger by saying, "i feel angry because...i hope next time you wil...". so nat, who was angry at her for releasing us late after school, said, "mdm goh, i feel angry becasue you release us late. i hope that in the future, you will not do it again"
she loves to sidetrack (about her daughters) too but.................... WE LOVE HER
she gave us a whole day snack time before the exams but she took it away cuz we ate during the lockdown drill :(((
she made us act out our compo and it turned out to be a joke
yonghao walking across the stage, holding a piece of paper saying,"2 minutes later"
one thing we love was her talking stick that she introduced to us

andddd 6/7 is awesome yay
